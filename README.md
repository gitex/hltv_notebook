# HLTV Data Analysis

The project is designed to teach pandas, numpy, and machine learning.

The basic idea is to work with HLTV data and predict the success 
of the team in certain cases. Also, to be able to look at the 
statistics from a different angle and understand - which team 
criteria are most important.

The project now contains:
- all HLTV matches from 30/6/2021 to 27/2/2023 (25400 matches).
